# Cortina d'Ampezzo: A Dining Guide

*January 13-15, 2026 — Babymoon in the Dolomites*

## I. The Mountain Huts

There is a particular kind of honesty in food served at altitude. The rifugi of the Dolomites—those mountain huts perched on impossible slopes—have no room for pretension. What arrives at your table was likely carried up by cable or mule. It must nourish skiers, hikers, the frozen and the exhausted. It must be simple because complexity is a luxury that doesn't survive the climb.

**Rifugio Scoiattoli** sits at 2,255 meters, reachable by the Cinque Torri chairlift. The views of the five towers are theatrical, but the canederli—bread dumplings in broth—are what you'll remember. This is mountain cooking stripped to its essence.

**Rifugio Averau** offers similar honesty at 2,413 meters, with polenta and wild game that taste of the place itself. Go for lunch. Linger. Watch the peaks turn gold.

**El Brite de Larieto** is technically a rifugio but feels more like a destination. The Michelin inspectors found it. So did the locals. Fabio Pompanin's cooking is rooted in Ladin tradition—the indigenous cuisine of these valleys—but executed with precision that belies the rustic setting.

## II. The Locals' Tables

Every ski resort has its tourist restaurants and its locals' secrets. Cortina, being Cortina, has more of the former than most. But the latter exist, and they're worth finding.

**Al Camin** is the answer to "where do Cortinesi actually eat?" It's in the Alverà neighborhood, away from the centro, in a warm wooden room that feels like a family's dining room—because it was. The casunziei (beet-filled pasta) are made the way they've always been made. The service assumes you'll stay a while.

**Tivoli** walks a careful line between fine and casual. Chef Graziano Prest has been here for decades, earning a reputation for consistency in a town where restaurants come and go with the seasons. The tasting menus are serious without being solemn. The wine list is deep.

**Pontejel Bierstube Forst** sounds like a beer hall and misleads accordingly. It's actually a refined restaurant serving Alto Adige cuisine with Austrian influences—think speck, schüttelbrot, and dishes that warm you from the inside. The "bierstube" part is simply honesty about the excellent local beers on tap.

**Ra Stua** deserves mention for its way with game. Venison, boar, hare—whatever the hunters bring, they prepare with respect. It's rustic but not rough.

## III. The Stars

The Dolomites have become a destination for serious dining, not despite their remoteness but because of it. The best chefs here cook with what the mountains give them—and the mountains give generously if you know where to look.

**St. Hubertus** (San Cassiano, ~30 min) — Norbert Niederkofler earned three Michelin stars by asking a radical question: what if a restaurant in the Alps only served what could be grown, raised, or foraged in the Alps? His "Cook the Mountain" philosophy isn't a gimmick; it's a discipline. Expect fermentation, preservation, and flavors you won't find anywhere else. This is destination dining—book well in advance.

**La Stüa de Michil** (Corvara, ~25 min) — One Michelin star, inside the legendary Hotel La Perla. Simone Cantafio's cooking is refined Ladin cuisine, the indigenous gastronomy of these valleys. The stüa (parlor) setting is intimate, the wine cellar extraordinary, and the tasting menu a journey through the territory.

**SanBrite** (Cortina) — Riccardo Gaspari's farm-to-table project takes the concept literally: the restaurant sits on his family's farm in Pian da Lago. One star, earned through obsessive attention to local ingredients. The location alone—a 10-minute drive from centro—makes it feel like a pilgrimage. Worth it.

**Tivoli** (Cortina) — Listed in the Michelin Guide for its modern approach to Dolomite cooking. Not starred, but recognized. See above.

**Porcino** (Badia, ~35 min) — Chef Andrea Irsara's one-starred restaurant focuses on mushrooms, obviously, but more broadly on the forests and meadows of Alta Badia. Creative, seasonal, worth the drive.

**AlpiNN** (Brunico, ~45 min) — Norbert Niederkofler's more casual sibling to St. Hubertus, at 2,275 meters inside the MMM Corones museum. The setting is spectacular—glass walls overlooking the Kronplatz slopes. The cooking is "Cook the Mountain" made accessible.

## IV. A Note on Reservations

You are visiting during ski season. The good restaurants book up. For starred places, reserve days or weeks in advance. For the rifugi, arrive early—they don't take reservations, and space is limited.

*Alejandra is pregnant: verify that each restaurant can accommodate her needs (no raw fish, careful with certain cheeses). Most Italian restaurants are gracious about this.*

## Art Note

Consider: Caspar David Friedrich's "Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog" — the figure contemplating the Alps feels appropriate for a dining guide about eating in the mountains.

Also: Giovanni Segantini's alpine paintings — he lived and died in these mountains, capturing their light like no one else.
